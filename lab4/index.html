<p> We created a pseudocode for an everyday task which we chose making a chicken breast and we created another pseudocde for a coding mechanic which was how to double jump.

	<div> Task 1 Pseudocode for cooking a chicken breast:
Make sure you have all the tools and ingredients (Chicken breast, seasonings of your choice (ex: salt and pepper), pan, oven, knife (optional), olive oil (or some oil of your choice), meat mallet (preferred), and a cutting board of some sort.
Ensure the chicken breast is fully thawed (the best method is to leave it in the fridge for at least 24 hours).
Evenly flatten chicken breast with a meat mallet on your cutting board.
Apply a generous amount of salt and a couple of pinches of pepper to both sides.
Allow chicken to sit at room temperature for 20 minutes.
Preheat the pan for 2 minutes over medium heat.
Apply 2 tbs of olive oil to the pan, making sure to cover the pan fully.
Let the oil heat up for 30 seconds.
Apply chicken breasts to the pan, and let it sit for 4 minutes.
Flip the chicken breast, and let it sit for 3 minutes.
Let the chicken breast sit for 5 minutes before cutting into it, and enjoy.

	Task 2: Pseudocode for a double-jump in a video game.
Already have a jumping mechanic setup.
Create a value that counts the number of available jumps for your player, set it to 2.
Create a condition that when the player jumps, 1 unit of the available jumps is depleted and they cannot jump if that value is at 0.
Create a boolean that checks if your player is grounded (if the player's model is colliding with the ground).
Reset the value of the available jumps to 2 if the grounded boolean is true.
